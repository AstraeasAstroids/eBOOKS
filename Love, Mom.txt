Love, Mom.
Chapter 1: The New House Smells Like Death.
Part 1 – Keys Still Warm.

The door clicked open like it remembered them.
Joyce Hymes stepped inside first, all in lavender: lavender blouse, lavender slacks, lavender lipstick that bled slightly into the folds above her lip. Her purse swung heavy on her shoulder, overstuffed with pill bottles, crusted Kleenex, and two tightly folded W-2 forms she never intended to file. Her eyes did a sweep of the room—faux-wood paneling, linoleum that sparkled in patches, curtains pre-installed and already crooked. She smiled.
“New,” she whispered. “Brand new.”
Behind her, Kimberly made it to the threshold, bracing herself on the aluminum doorframe. She wore a portable oxygen tank across her chest like a baby sling, and every breath sounded like a wheezing tire patch.
“We got this,” Kimberly panted, one foot inside, one still on the tiny porch. “Don’t it feel like a blessing?”
Joyce didn’t answer right away. She ran a finger along the kitchen counter, pretending to check for dust, even though it was immaculate. “I told you the Lord would provide,” she said. “This place was meant for us. People don’t just walk into deals like this.”
The house was a doublewide on a corner lot—Lot 7, in a mobile home park outside Twin Falls. The realtor said it had “good bones” and “minimal previous occupancy,” which Joyce took to mean that someone probably died in it but no one filed the paperwork. They paid cash from the sale of the burned-out house Ray tried to kill her in. Now it was theirs.
Their names were both on the title.
“Keys were still warm,” Joyce said, holding them up. “Man must’ve left ‘em on the table just before we got here.”
Kimberly stepped inside finally, dragging her rolling suitcase behind her, and the first thing she said once the door shut was: “What’s that smell?”
Joyce didn’t sniff. “Plastic. Vinyl. New house smell. That’s all.”
But Kimberly wrinkled her nose. “No. It’s like…” She searched for the word. “Sweet. But rotten.”
“It’s a blessing,” Joyce said flatly. “Don’t sniff it like it’s a curse.”
She opened the fridge. Empty. Perfect. She closed it, hard. She always hated half-full fridges. People who left behind mustard and expired pickles were, to her, ghosts who never knew how to die proper.

Back inside, Joyce hung a faded wooden sign over the kitchen sink. It read:
“Bless This Mess — Love, Mom”
She hammered it in with the back of a butter knife.
Kimberly, now seated at the edge of a floral-patterned loveseat, pulled her legs up slowly. Her ankles were swollen and grey. She eyed the room’s corners like a stray cat, unconvinced.
“We really gonna be alright here?” she asked.
Joyce turned and flashed her smile—the one that could raise the dead, or at least make them sit up and ask for tea.
“Kimmy,” she said, “We ain’t just gonna be alright. We’re gonna thrive. God sent us this house on a paper plate with a silver bow.”
She glanced once more out the window toward the man across the street.
“And I think He sent us company too.”

Part 2 – First Contact. 

He moved in sometime in late March. One U-Haul. No talking. Two cats in crates that looked like small prisons.
Joyce watched through the blinds, wearing a full face of foundation and a silk robe she hadn’t laundered since Arizona.
“He’s got cats,” she said.
Kimberly, seated at the table with her foot on a heating pad, didn’t look up. “You got dead husbands. Everybody’s got baggage.”
Joyce narrowed her eyes. “They’re probably indoor. Makes ‘em passive. I hate a passive man.”

For weeks, they just watched him.
Clark didn’t wave. Didn’t decorate. Just kept fixing things: porch rail, mailbox hinge, weather stripping.
Kimberly assumed he was lonely.
Joyce assumed he was guilty.
They were both right.

By June, the weather turned mean and Jerry from next door started meddling.
“You should say hi to Clark,” he told Kimberly across the fence.
She flicked ash and muttered, “I don’t say hi to strangers with cats unless they’re handing me drugs.”
“He smokes,” Jerry added. “You smoke.”
Kimberly rolled her eyes. Still, when she saw Clark at the mailbox later that day, she gave him a raised hand.
“Hey,” she said.
He nodded. “Hey.”
It was quick. Forgettable. But Joyce saw it happen.

The next morning, Joyce made lemon bars from scratch—her signature version, with double zest and powdered sugar like snow.
She wore tight jeans, a rhinestone belt, and her second-best blouse. Full face. Big hair. Red lipstick so matte it looked carved on.
Kimberly walked past her in the hallway and muttered, “You look like you’re about to charge for services.”
Joyce smiled sweetly. “Don’t be jealous just ‘cause your T-shirt’s older than my last marriage.”

She carried the plate across the street like she was delivering a final notice.
Clark was in the yard, shirt sleeves rolled, watching one of his cats—Agnes—pace in the window. The other, Marble, was nowhere to be seen.
“Morning,” Joyce said.
Clark straightened up. “Morning.”
“I’m Joyce. Across the street. This here’s a plate of my best lemon bars. I don’t bring ‘em to just anyone, so don’t die before eating them.”
He took them with both hands. “Thanks.”
“You’re Clark?”
He nodded.
“Widowed?” she asked bluntly.
He blinked. “Yes.”
Joyce tilted her head. “Kids?”
“Just cats.”
“Two?”
“Agnes and Marble.”
Joyce smiled. “I see you’re a complicated man.”
Clark smiled back. “I’m really not.”

From the porch, Kimberly watched them. Lit another cigarette. Didn’t look away.
Jerry wandered past behind her, muttering, “Well. There she goes.”
Kimberly muttered back, “Poor bastard.”


Part 3 – The Curtain War.
Joyce and Kimberly try to pick out curtains. It's just curtains. Except it isn’t. Every fabric carries a memory, every color is a weapon. And in the end, it’s never about the window—it’s about who controls the view.

They stood in the middle of the Dollar Value Discount Mart for almost an hour, parked in front of a sagging rack of curtain panels. A crooked sign above them read “EASY HANG FABRICS – ONLY $9.99 PER PAIR.” It might as well have said Choose Your Weapon.
Joyce held up a set of faux-silk drapes in deep burgundy, fanned them out like a magician’s cape. “These,” she said, “make a statement.”
Kimberly sat in the scooter, arms folded, oxygen tank clipped to the side like a hostage. She squinted. “They’re too dark. They’ll suck all the light out the room.”
“That’s the point,” Joyce snapped. “Sun fades the furniture. These’ll keep the couch from going piss-yellow before Halloween.”
“They look like a funeral home.”
“Well, maybe that’s appropriate, considering the vibes in that house.”
Kimberly rolled backward an inch. “I was thinking something softer. You know... pastel?”
Joyce groaned, already lighting a cigarette even though they were indoors. She let it dangle unlit between her lips just to piss people off.
“You want to die in a room full of pastels?” she muttered. “What are you, seven?”
“I just want something that doesn’t make me feel like I’m suffocating.”
“You’ve got a machine for that.”
Kimberly’s face went red and then pale. The scooter beeped softly as she backed away from the curtain rack. Joyce kept her eyes on the fabric.
“Fine,” she said, not looking at her. “Pick your precious pastels. But don’t come crying to me when the sun peels the goddamn couch to bone.”
They bought two sets. Joyce’s burgundy for the living room. Kimberly’s pale yellow tulip-print for the guest bedroom—the one she’d be sleeping in.
As they rolled through checkout, Kimberly finally spoke again. “Do you remember when you took me to pick out my prom dress and wouldn’t let me get the blue one?”
Joyce didn’t even glance up from counting her coupons.
“Of course I remember. That thing made you look like a goddamn urinal cake.”
Kimberly didn’t speak again the whole ride home.

Back at the house, Joyce installed her curtains first. She didn’t measure. She just punched the rods in above the windows, crooked and too low. The burgundy cloth dragged on the floor like a collapsed cape.
She stepped back, hands on hips.
“See?” she said. “Looks like royalty lives here.”
Clark walked by outside just then, Agnes trotting behind him on a leash made from yellow yarn.
Kimberly, standing behind Joyce with her arms full of yellow tulip curtains, said nothing.
Joyce waved out the window like a debutante.
Clark lifted a hand. His smile barely happened.
Agnes hissed at the glass.

Part 4 – The Smell in the Vents.
The house is new, but the past won't stay buried. Kimberly smells something that isn't there—or maybe it is. Joyce distracts herself with casino fantasies and old cigarettes while Clark watches, patient as a spider. And the cat? The cat never blinks.

The bedroom vents rattled once around midnight.
Kimberly sat up too fast, the oxygen tube yanking taut behind her ear. Her chest whistled. She pressed the palm of her hand to it, then peeled back the blanket. The air had shifted again. Not colder, not warmer. Just... wrong.
She sniffed. It was faint. But it was there.
“Joyce,” she called out. No answer.
She eased herself out of bed, bare feet hitting the cold laminate floor, and followed the smell. Past the kitchenette, past the bathroom where the tiles still smelled like off-brand bleach. The scent grew stronger the closer she got to the hallway vent.
She crouched.
It wasn’t gas. It wasn’t mold. It was sweet—like rotting fruit soaked in baby oil, like birthday cake someone threw up in a car trunk three summers ago. Artificial and warm.
She leaned closer.
Then the vent rattled again—just once—and Kimberly screamed, stumbling back and landing hard against the doorframe.

Joyce was already awake. She sat cross-legged on the couch with a black coffee and a pack of Misty Menthols, flipping through an old casino matchbook like it was scripture. She didn't look up when Kimberly entered.
"You holler like that again," Joyce muttered, "and I'm gonna assume you're either dead or trying to get attention. Neither one’s attractive."
Kimberly’s hand trembled on the back of a chair. “Something’s in the vent.”
Joyce snorted. “Yeah. Air.”
“No, I mean it’s... it's moving. And it smells.”
Joyce took a drag. “Oh, for fuck’s sake. You think it’s Ray’s ghost, come to crawl up through the ductwork and finish the job?”
Kimberly didn’t answer. Just stood there, pale and half-shaking.
Joyce finally looked up, eyes sharp beneath the haze. “You really think some shit from the past’s gonna crawl out of the walls and eat us?”
She leaned forward, crushed the cigarette in an ashtray already packed with the day’s worth.
“Kimmy. If the past wanted us dead, it would’ve got us already. Ain’t nobody that patient.”

Across the street, Clark stood at his sink, washing two spoons he didn’t use.
Behind him, Agnes the cat sat on the windowsill, her eyes trained unblinking at Joyce’s front door. Her tail didn’t move. Her ears were flat.

Later that night, Kimberly lay curled on her side, facing the wall. The smell came and went like waves from a far-off landfill. Not enough to scream. Not enough to ignore.
From the other room, Joyce was singing low and slow. Something bluesy. No words. Just a hum with bite.
Then silence.
Then a cough.
Then one last word.
“Blessed,” Joyce whispered, to no one.
And in the vent above Kimberly’s head, something scratched once, faint and dry—like a thumbnail across cardboard—and went still.


Part 5 – Grandma’s New Game.
Joyce returns to The Silver Widow casino to “see who’s still breathing,” armed with fake beauty, remote-control curtains, and a fresh pack of lies. Kimberly stays behind, mesmerized by a booklet she’ll never afford. Meanwhile, Clark observes—one quarter at a time.

The catalog came with the house, stuffed in a welcome packet next to an expired pizza coupon and a tiny bottle of hand sanitizer shaped like a cow. Joyce flipped to the third page and found them—“Deluxe Drapery, Motorized, Soft Glide™.” She circled them with a red lip liner.
“See this?” she said, shoving the catalog toward Kimberly’s face. “This is class.”
Kimberly squinted at the price tag. “Four hundred and seventy dollars.”
“For drapes that move themselves. It’s called automation, Kim. Try to keep up.”
“We can’t even afford a second toilet brush.”
Joyce closed the catalog with a snap. “That’s what the casino’s for.”

The Silver Widow still reeked of burnt carpet and fryer grease. The parking lot lights buzzed like insect wings. Joyce strutted in like a pageant winner on the last leg of her reign, cigarette unlit in her mouth, hair teased up like cotton candy with trauma.
The bouncer barely glanced up.
Inside, she was home.
She didn’t sit. Not yet. She made the rounds like a pastor doing a funeral wake—light hand on shoulders, whisper in the ear, loud laugh, then gone.
“Carl still here?” she asked the bartender, leaning on one elbow.
Carl was dead. Had been for six years.
“Oh,” she said flatly, “Well, he owed me twenty bucks, so somebody better cough up.”

She didn’t gamble at first.
She watched.
Young girls in dusty crop tops losing rent money. Veterans chain-smoking at nickel slots. A man with no teeth and too many rings slapping the arm of a machine like it owed him a childhood.
She sipped a flat soda and smiled.
When she finally did sit, it was at the end machine in the corner. Her favorite. The screen still had a crack across the bottom that made every cherry look like it was bleeding.
Joyce rubbed her palms together. “Alright, motherfuckers,” she whispered. “Let’s win me some curtains.”

Across the floor, Clark sat alone at a penny slot, dressed like someone who shouldn’t be in a casino—oversized flannel, faded jeans, running shoes with dust in the creases. He played a quarter every fifteen minutes. No rhythm. No confidence.
He watched her through the reflection in the machine’s screen.
She was smiling with her whole face, the way some people scream.

Back at home, Kimberly sat cross-legged in her bed, catalog open on her lap, pen uncapped. She circled the curtains too. Then drew a box around them. Then filled the box in with shaky ink.
The house creaked as the wind hit it. Something whined through the hallway.
Kimberly closed the catalog and put it under her pillow.
She didn’t say a prayer.
She just whispered, “Fuck you, Joyce,” and turned off the light.


Chapter 2: Clark Buys the Pie.
Part 1 – Sunday Best, Monday Mouth.

The knock came at 3:47 p.m., the kind of time people choose when they want it to feel casual but planned. Kimberly glanced up from the ashtray, exhaling a small ghost. Joyce didn’t look up. She was already smiling.
She opened the door with the slow poise of a woman who’d just been voted class president in a school that no longer existed.
“Well look who brought dessert,” she purred.
Clark stood there in his tired cardigan, holding a pie in one hand and a half-empty bag of potato rolls in the other.
“Just a little welcome gift,” he mumbled. “Supermarket had peach. I wasn’t sure.”
Joyce took the pie like it was a first-place trophy. “You ever seen a woman say no to peach?” she asked, already turning toward the kitchen. “Come in before the heat eats your knees.”
Clark stepped in slowly. Agnes sat on the porch rail outside, glaring through the window like she was reading a will that didn’t name her. She never crossed the threshold. Joyce claimed it was allergies. The cat knew better.

Kimberly sat in her usual corner of the loveseat, legs folded awkwardly, spine stiff. She nodded a little, just enough to acknowledge him. Joyce had already cleared off the table, pulled down the plastic place mats she’d been pretending were “antiques,” and started slicing the pie with a plastic knife.
Clark took the seat farthest from her but didn’t mention it. He glanced at Kimberly. She looked worse than yesterday—paler, drawn in. Her fingers twitched near the cigarette pack in her lap, but she didn’t light one yet.
“House looks nice,” he offered gently.
Joyce didn’t look up. “New drapes’ll make it look nicer. Motorized. That’s the future, Clark. Curtains that move when I tell ‘em to. Just like husbands used to.”
Clark smiled politely.
Joyce cut him a slice so thin it was insulting. Gave herself the crust corner. Kimberly didn’t ask for any.
“I gotta say,” Joyce continued, lifting her fork, “It’s nice having someone quiet across the street. Last neighbors we had—Jesus. Pit bulls, dirt bikes, screaming babies all hours of the night. Like hell with a day-care license.”
Clark chewed slowly. He didn’t argue. That was the play.
Joyce leaned her elbow on the table. “You a widow for real, or just say that so women feed you pie?”
Clark blinked. “For real. My wife passed in March.”
She stared at him just long enough to register sincerity, then took another bite.
“Well,” she said. “That makes two of us.”
Clark nodded, unsure how far to push it.
“I didn’t know,” he offered. “I mean, I’m sorry.”
Joyce waved it off with her fork. “Please. He was a miserable sonofabitch. Got himself full of cancer, couldn’t even die right. Took three whole years and most of my fuckin’ savings before he finally quit. But I’m a forgiving woman. Told the mortician to make him look peaceful.”
She wiped her mouth with a napkin that wasn’t there. “They didn’t.”
Kimberly lit her cigarette finally. Her fingers trembled when she struck the lighter.
Clark turned his eyes toward her.
“You okay?” he asked.
Joyce cut in before Kimberly could answer. “She’s fine. Always fine. She’s dramatic, but she ain’t dead.”
Kimberly blew smoke at the ceiling. “I had surgery on my back.”
Joyce sighed. “Yeah. A hundred thousand dollars’ worth, and she still walks like a drunk praying mantis.”
Clark said nothing.
Joyce stood, tossed her plate in the sink with a loud clatter.
“You know,” she said over her shoulder, “some folks just have a hard time letting go of pain. Real or imagined. Me? I say fuck it and buy curtains.”
She looked back and smiled at Clark like they shared some private joke.
“You should come by more,” Joyce said as Clark rose to leave, adjusting the cardigan that always looked like it came with grief. “I got a bottle of sherry and a spare chair with your name on it. Just you, though. Kim don’t leave the house. Too many stairs in the world.”
Kimberly didn’t look up. “Ain’t about the stairs.”
Joyce smiled. “Of course it ain’t, sweetie.”
Agnes hissed, just once, from under the table.

Part 2 – What’s Worth Remembering.
Clark visits again, this time with no pie—just politeness. Joyce offers nothing but the present moment. When he gently probes into her past, she dodges like a pro. Kimberly watches the whole thing unfold, saying nothing. She’s seen this performance before. Clark hasn’t.

Clark returned the next day at 4:12 p.m., this time without the pie. He brought a small plastic container of potato salad he didn’t make and a grocery receipt as if to prove it. Joyce opened the door with a dish towel in one hand and a look like she'd just been asked to host the Emmys.
“Back so soon?” she said, stepping aside. “You keep this up, I’m gonna start charging admission.”
Clark gave a half-shrug. “Didn’t want to waste leftovers.”
“Leftovers are how I built a family,” she said, then louder, “Kim! We got starch!”
Kimberly didn’t answer. She was in the back room pretending to sleep but listening like it was a court deposition.
Agnes stayed outside on the porch railing again, tail flicking like a metronome. She locked eyes with Joyce through the screen door. Joyce refused to blink.

Clark sat at the table, hands folded like he was bracing for bad news.
Joyce poured two glasses of off-brand sweet tea and slid one across to him. She didn’t ask what he wanted. She never did.
“So what did your wife do?” she asked. “Before, you know. The dramatic exit.”
Clark paused. “She was a bookkeeper. Self-employed. Real organized.”
Joyce whistled low. “Oof. Sounds like a woman who’d alphabetize the pantry and divorce you over a junk drawer.”
Clark smiled softly. “She was a good woman.”
Joyce nodded once, then immediately looked away like she’d accidentally acknowledged a bad smell.
“I don’t keep pictures out,” she said, apropos of nothing. “Never saw the point. People get stuck in ‘em. Hang on to lies ‘cause the lighting was good that day.”
Clark gestured around the blank walls. “Yeah, I noticed.”
She sipped her tea and leaned back. “My girls say it’s because I don’t like to remember. They think that makes me guilty.”
“Are they right?”
Joyce smiled, thin and practiced. “They’re not exactly Rhodes scholars, Clark. One of ‘em thought the Great Depression was a reality show.”
Clark laughed once. Quietly. “You got daughters?”
“Three I admit to.”
He waited.
She didn’t elaborate.

In the hallway, Kimberly sat on the closed toilet lid, joints stiff, listening through the cracked door. She stared at a bottle of lidocaine cream and wondered if she had enough left to make it to Thursday without screaming.
Joyce’s voice filtered in clear.
“They all think I’m the villain. Every family’s got one. It’s like jury duty. Somebody’s gotta take the heat.”
Clark’s voice was barely audible. “Did you… do something to deserve it?”
Joyce laughed sharp and sudden. “Jesus, Clark. What are you, a fucking therapist?”
Clark didn’t flinch. “No. Just listening.”
Joyce got up, rinsed her glass, turned off the sink with a little too much force.
“You ever notice how when men fall apart, they get statues? But when women do it, they get blamed?”
She didn’t wait for an answer.

By the time Clark left, the sun was folding in on itself. Agnes jumped down from the railing and followed him across the street.
Joyce watched him go from the window, smoking a cigarette she never lit. Kimberly emerged from the hallway with a grunt, one hand on her hip, the other pressing into the scar on her lower back like it might open again.
“You really like feeding that man’s ego?” she asked.
Joyce turned, smirking. “You’re just mad he didn’t bring you any potato salad.”


Part 3 – Jackpot Routine.

Joyce didn’t say, “Let’s go to Jackpot.”
She said, “We’re going south.”
Clark figured that meant groceries. Maybe a pharmacy errand. It wasn’t until they passed Hollister that he realized where she was aiming.
“Thought you only went down there on birthdays,” he said.
Joyce was chewing spearmint gum like it owed her money. “Every day’s my birthday when I feel lucky.”

Jackpot, Nevada looked like a cartoon of itself. Half-dead signs, smoky lights even at noon, a layer of dust over everything but the chips. Joyce pulled into the lot like she owned it—then stole it.
Clark followed her into the Cactus Rose Casino, one of the few left with physical coins instead of vouchers. She called it “real gambling.”
“This place,” she said, “has seen more breakdowns than a Ford dealership.”

Kimberly used to go.
But not anymore.
Last time, she’d slipped in the parking lot and scraped her knee trying to carry a Sprite back to the car. Joyce told her she was “ruining the vibe.” Since then, Kimberly stayed behind—lit up a joint, kept the curtains drawn, watched Dateline and texted Roxanne when the weed hit sideways.
“She’s in Jackpot,” Kimberly would write.
“I hope she wins, or loses big. Anything to quiet her down.”

Inside the Cactus Rose, Joyce made a lap first. She didn’t sit right away. That was for amateurs.
Clark watched her circle—like a shark in rhinestones.
When she finally picked a machine, she whispered, “This one paid out after I told Ray I loved him. He didn’t believe me, but the machine did.”
Clark said nothing.
Joyce turned and smiled. “First time here?”
He nodded.
“You’re gonna love it. It smells like air freshener and men who used to matter.”
She sat, lit a menthol, and fed in a twenty like she was putting a tip in God’s cleavage.
Chapter 2: Clark Buys the Pie
Part 4 – Casino Confessional
Joyce brings Clark to The Cactus Rose Casino in Jackpot for the first time. He thinks he’s just tagging along. What he witnesses is ritual, compulsion, and maybe the truest form of Joyce’s personality. She doesn’t gamble—she conjures. She doesn’t play—she performs. And Clark sees, fully, what she is when the lights hit her right.

Jackpot, Nevada was an hour and change from Buhl, and Joyce made the drive like she was doing a lap around her kingdom.
Clark sat in the passenger seat, watching the sagebrush blur into grey smears. She didn’t talk much, just hummed and tapped her fingers on the steering wheel, cigarette wedged between her lips but unlit. He noticed she didn’t smoke it until they hit the casino lot. Like it was part of the outfit.
The Cactus Rose was ugly and proud of it. Still used real coins. Still smelled like French fries and floor polish. Joyce parked in her usual spot—dead center between the dumpsters and the neon sign that flickered WELCOME like it couldn’t decide who deserved it.
“You come here often?” Clark asked.
Joyce grinned. “Honey, I was baptized in this parking lot.”

Inside, she transformed. Joyce in the house was sharp and snide. Joyce in the casino was electric.
She floated across the floor like she was on a first date with herself—hair teased high, her “lucky bitch” tank on full display, bracelets clinking like dog tags. People nodded. One old man waved.
“Your crowd?” Clark asked.
She didn’t look at him. “They remember who used to win.”
They passed three roulette tables and a wall of penny slots. Joyce picked her machine fast—like she heard it calling her—and dropped onto the stool with a sigh of possession.
Clark lingered nearby. Watched.

She fed in a twenty and whispered, “Come on, baby. Don’t be shy. Mama needs a curtain.”
Spin. Lose. Spin. Small win. Spin. Lose.
She kept muttering under her breath:
“Be good to me.”
“Oh, you dirty bastard.”
“You liked me better with Ronnie.”
“Yes, yes, yes—no! You prick.”
Clark eventually brought her a Coke. She didn’t ask for it.
“I don’t drink brown soda,” she snapped, not turning her head.
“You’re dehydrated,” he said.
She took it anyway.

After her third twenty, she started slapping the spin button like it was personal.
“Most of the men I’ve ruined started in places like this,” she said casually, as if reading a weather report. “You know that?”
Clark nodded slightly. “No, but I believe it.”
She chuckled. “Found 'em sober, bored, thinkin’ they were still fixable. I gave ‘em what they wanted. Then I gave ‘em what I wanted.”
Clark asked nothing.
“One of ‘em tried to kill me,” she added. “Didn’t quite pull it off. But I respect the effort.”
Clark watched the light from the machine flicker across her cheekbones.
“You ever been that angry?” she asked.
Clark answered without looking at her. “Not yet.”
She smiled. “That’s what I like about you.”

She lost sixty dollars, then won back thirty. Then lost it again and screamed “FUCK” loud enough that the man at the adjacent slot machine got up and left.
“Sensitive prick,” Joyce muttered.
Clark stayed seated. Watched it all.
Her eyes never left the screen. Her fingers never stopped moving. She didn’t blink when she hit zero.
Just fed in another twenty like she was tipping the void.

Outside, it was cold again.
Inside, the machine blinked. Clark noticed her posture—spine curved like a question mark, wrist twitching on the button.
She whispered something as she pressed spin again.
Clark leaned slightly to hear it.
“Come on, baby.
Come on, sweet thing.
Give Mama her motorized fucking curtains.”
