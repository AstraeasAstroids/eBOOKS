The Time to Shine.
By Gwendolyn Nicholson.
Once upon a quiet hill,
lived a girl named Luma, soft and still.
She watched the stars, she watched the skies—
but never felt she could rise.
She saw the others leap and twirl,
singing loud, each dazzling girl.
"I'm not like them," she whispered low,
"I’m just a shadow in their glow."
But deep inside, a spark was there,
hidden underneath her care.
A tiny light that softly gleamed,
that glowed the brightest when she dreamed.
A time would come—the big school show,
where every child would let their light glow.
Luma trembled, full of fear,
"What if I don’t belong up here?"
But then she breathed and stood up tall.
She'd practiced hard—she knew it all!
She closed her eyes and took her place,
a little tremble on her face.
She sang her song, she gave her all,
though butterflies danced in the hall.
And when she stopped, the room was still...
Then claps erupted, loud and shrill!
Luma beamed and felt so free—
not like them, but proud to be me.
Her heart felt big, her spirit light—
her time to shine had felt just right.
And from that day, through storm or sun,
she knew her journey had begun.
To shine is not to be the best,
but just to try, and give your best.
