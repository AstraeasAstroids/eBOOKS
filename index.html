                            This is the story of the daughter of Miriam and Azriel, sister of Yael, dancer of fig grives and firelight.
                            Set against the vibrant and tumultuous backdrop of 1st-century Judea, Daughter tells the powerful first-person story of a woman who suffered for twelve long years with a relentless illness.                            
                            Shunned and isolated, she lived in the shadows—until a single, daring act of faith led her to Jesus, the healer whose touch changed everything.
                            Through vivid encounters with Jesus, His disciples, and the unfolding events of His ministry, crucifixion, and resurrection, 
                            this novel explores not only the miracle of physical healing but the profound inner transformation of a woman whose faith defied the impossible.
                            Blending historical detail with heartfelt spirituality, Daughter is a moving tribute to hope, resilience, and the enduring power of belief.

                            Love, Mom is a biography of the artist's mother.
                            Told in brutal detail and laced with dry humor. 
                             Love, Mom is a matriarchal horror about generational trauma, truth-telling, and the sacred act of finally saying no.
                            It’s not about healing. It’s about surviving the inheritance.

                                On a terraforming outpost on Europa, a scientist studying microbial life discovers a strange organic pod buried beneath the ice. 
                                The organism inside appears to be evolving at an accelerated rate, learning from its environment—and from her.

                            A brilliant clockmaker discovers that a celebrated inventor has been replaced by a lifelike automaton bearing the clockmaker’s own secret designs. 
                            Plunged into a hidden conspiracy, the clockmaker teams up with a resourceful street thief and a repentant insider to unravel the workings 
                            of a clandestine society bent on substituting humanity with perfected machines. Racing against the Horologium’s midnight chime, 
                            they infiltrate subterranean forges, outwit sentient sentinels, and face a towering “Perfection Automaton” fused with a loved mentor’s mind. 
                            In a final duel atop the giant clockface, they must choose between shattering the mechanism that would enslave the city or seizing control of its 
                            fate—proving that true life cannot be dictated by gears alone.
