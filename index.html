                            This is the story of the daughter of Miriam and Azriel, sister of Yael, dancer of fig grives and firelight.
                            Set against the vibrant and tumultuous backdrop of 1st-century Judea, Daughter tells the powerful first-person story of a woman who suffered for twelve long years with a relentless illness.                            
                            Shunned and isolated, she lived in the shadowsâ€”until a single, daring act of faith led her to Jesus, the healer whose touch changed everything.
                            Through vivid encounters with Jesus, His disciples, and the unfolding events of His ministry, crucifixion, and resurrection, 
                            this novel explores not only the miracle of physical healing but the profound inner transformation of a woman whose faith defied the impossible.
                            Blending historical detail with heartfelt spirituality, Daughter is a moving tribute to hope, resilience, and the enduring power of belief.

                            Love, Mom is a biography of the artist's mother.
                            Told in brutal detail and laced with dry humor. 
                             Love, Mom is a matriarchal horror about generational trauma, truth-telling, and the sacred act of finally saying no.
                            Itâ€™s not about healing. Itâ€™s about surviving the inheritance.

                            On a terraforming outpost on Europa, a scientist studying microbial life discovers a strange organic pod buried beneath the ice. 
                            The organism inside appears to be evolving at an accelerated rate, learning from its environmentâ€”and from her. 
                            Crew members begin changingâ€”mentally first, then physically. Paranoia grows as no one knows whoâ€™s been infectedâ€¦
                            or why theyâ€™re evolving.
